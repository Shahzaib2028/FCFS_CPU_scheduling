## What is First Come First Serve CPU Scheduling? ##

First Come First Serve (FCFS) is an operating system scheduling algorithm that automatically executes queued requests and processes in order of their arrival.

It is the easiest and simplest CPU scheduling algorithm.

## Characteristics of FCFS method ##

It supports non-preemptive and pre-emptive scheduling algorithm.

Jobs are always executed on a first-come, first-serve basis.

It is easy to implement and use.

This method is poor in performance, and the general wait time is quite high.
